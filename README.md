🙋‍♂️Hello innovators,
A intersting Mathematical riddle in Maths which is still a mystery called 3x+1 map or Collatz conjecture or Hassie's algorithm, which is simple to understand :-
🧠
1. Take a any natural number.(let x)
2. If the number is even then divide it by 2.( x -> x/2)
             OR
   else if the number odd then multiply it by 3 and add 1 ( x -> 3x+1)
3. Repeat these steps for every answer you get and you'll find that for any value of x you'll end up to 1 and loop of(4,2,1).

🤩
I simply programmed it. so that you can get a 📈 graph as illustrator which shows value after each iteration (Y-axis) and number of iterations(X-axis).
just enter your desired input and see the magic.

you'll observed that for any value of input it end up with 1.
